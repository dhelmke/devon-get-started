= Further Information

== Official Website
The official devon website is link:https://www.devonfw.com/[devonfw.com]. It contains useful links, information about the devon initative, its members and repositories as well as link:https://troom.capgemini.com/sites/vcc/devon/training_hub.aspx[training videos].

== devon Guide
The link:https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-guide[devon guide] is a _very_ extensive link:https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-guide/raw/master/devonfw_guide.pdf[PDF], that is sourced from the documentation of official repositories within the devonfw organization. It is automatically generated and included in the files of each devon distribution.

== devon4j
The backend of most devon applications is built with Java. To speed up the development process, the link:https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j[devon4j] stack provides pre-selected frameworks and tools that ensure a secure backend-design which conforms with current standards.

== devon4ng
The frontend of most devon applications is based around the Angular framework. For this reason, link:https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng[devon4ng] provides an Angular application template as well as an application template combining Angular and Ionic (another frontend framework). It also contains various samples, which explain aspects like routing, theming, internationalization, Electron-support, etc.

== CobiGen
"The _Code-based Incremental Generator_ link:https://github.com/devonfw/tools-cobigen[CobiGen] is build as an extensible framework for incremental code generation." New devon users will most likely interact with CobiGen's Eclipse plugin to automatically generate Java classes based on certain data structures and their respective entity classes (as demonstrated in the link:[JumpTheQueue tutorial]).

== VS Code Extension Pack
The link:https://github.com/devonfw/extension-pack-vscode[devonfw Platform Extension Pack] is a collection of useful Extensions for Visual Studio Code that support the development of devon applications. You can get it link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=devonfw.devonfw-extension-pack[here].

[NOTE]
====
Please be aware that the Extension Pack is quite 'extensive' and will take a while to download and install. It might also slow down VS Code depending on your system. To avoid this you can take a look at the link:https://github.com/devonfw/extension-pack-vscode/blob/master/README.md[included Extensions] and install them individually if needed.
